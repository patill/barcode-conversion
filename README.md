# barcode-conversion
Converts Pori's old barcodes to be recognized by Aurora
Works in form of a webpage (main.html) which converts input by adding Pori's
code '609' in between the barcode's numbers and barcode's ending two or
three letters.

The conversion can be used on the webpages
 - patill.github.io/barcode-conversion/pages/main.html (converting with button)
 - patill.github.io/barcode-conversion/pages/show-barcode-now.html (converting immediately)
